Programs-notebooks in which I write down my knowledge in programming

**C++ branch** - learning C++ language  
**Algo branch** - algorithms and structures  
**Python branch** - learning Python language  

The command ***all*** returns all available sections  
To read a section, just enter its name

**Warning:** the program is under development, so not all sections can work
